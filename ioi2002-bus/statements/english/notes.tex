The following figures show the bus networks for the inputs given above. If in Example
1 bus stops 3 and 4 are selected as hubs then the longest route is either between bus
stops 2 and 5 or between bus stops 2 and 1. There is no better choice for the hubs, and
the answer is 20.

For the bus network in Example 2, if bus stops 5 and 6 are selected as hubs then the
longest route is obtained between bus stops 2 and 7. There is no better choice for the
hubs, and the answer is 25.

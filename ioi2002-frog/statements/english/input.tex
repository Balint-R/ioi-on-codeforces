Your program is to read from standard input. 

The first line contains two integers $R$ and $C$ $(1 \le R, C \le 5\,000)$, respectively the number of rows and columns in your rice paddy. 

The second line contains the single integer $N$ $(3 \le N \le 5000)$, the number of flattened rice plants. 

Each of the remaining $N$ lines contains two integers, the row number $r_i$ $(1 \le r_i \le R)$ and the column number $c_i$ $(1 \le c_i \le C)$ of a flattened rice plant, separated by one blank. Each flattened plant is only listed once.

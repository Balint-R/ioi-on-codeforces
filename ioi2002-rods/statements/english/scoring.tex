If your program violates any of the constraints (e.g., more than 400 queries), or if
your program's output (the locations of the rods) is not correct, the score is 0.

If your program's output is correct, then your score depends on the number of queries
for each testing data. For each test case if the number of queries is at most 100,
then you get 5 points. If number of queries is between 101 ad 200 times, you get 3 points. If the number of queries is between 201 and 400, then you get 1 point.

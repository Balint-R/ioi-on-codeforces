Your program is to write to standard output. The output consists of $N$ lines, each
containing a pair of code numbers each preceded by a sign character. These are codes
pairs that will direct the teleporter to the given region sequence. Note that there must be
no blank following a sign, but there must be a single space after the first code number.
If there are several solutions your program can output any one of them. If there are no
solutions your program should output the single integer $0$.

Each input file is organized as follows. The first line of an input file contains one
integer N $(5 \le N \le 2000)$, meaning that there are $N$ rows and $N$ columns in the image. 

The remaining lines represent the rows of the image from top to bottom. Each line contains $N$ integers: the pixel values in the row from left to right. Each of these integers is either a $0$ or a $1$, where $0$ represents a white pixel and $1$ represents a black pixel.

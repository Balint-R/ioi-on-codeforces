If
\begin{itemize}
\item the XOR calls specified in your output file do not generate the required image, or
\item the number of XOR calls specified in your output file is not $K$, or
\item in your output file, $K > 40000$, or
\item your output file contains such an XOR call that $L>R$ or $T>B$, or
\item your output file contains an XOR call which does not have positive coordinates, or
\item your output file contains an XOR call with a coordinate value exceeding $N$,
then your score is zero. 
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, your score is
$1+ \frac{9 \times CallsInBestKnownSolution}{CallsInYourAnswer}$.

The score is rounded to the first decimal place for each case. The total score is rounded
off to the nearest integer.

Suppose that you submit a solution with 121 XOR calls. If that is the best submission of
all contestants, your score is 10. If the best of the submitted solution of all contestants
uses 98 XOR calls, your score becomes $1+ \frac{9 \times 98}{121}(\approx 8.289)$, which will be rounded to $8.3$.

Unfortunately, no best solution is known to me for sure. So, if you found solution, which is better then jury's one, you will receive \t{denial of judgment} verdict. In that case, contact me (by codeforces message to user PavelKunyavskiy) and I will eventually add your solution as new best one and rejudge problem.

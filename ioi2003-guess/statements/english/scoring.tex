\textbf{Correctness: 30\% of points}

Programs will receive full score on correctness only if the cow specified is the only cow that is consistent with the answers given. A program that asks more than 100  questions for a test case will receive no points for that test case.

\textbf{Question count: 70\% of points}

The remaining points will be determined by the number of questions required to correctly determine the cow. The test cases are designed to reward minimizing the worst-case question count. Partial credit will be given for near-optimal question counts.

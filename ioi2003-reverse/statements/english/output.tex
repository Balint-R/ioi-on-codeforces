The first line of output should contain nine space-separated values representing the desired initial values of the registers, in order (register 1, then register 2, etc.).

The rest of the output file should contain the ordered list of operations to be performed, one per line. Thus, the third line contains the first operation to perform, and so on. The last line of the file should be the one that prints 0. Each line should be a valid operation. The instructions should be formatted as in the example output.

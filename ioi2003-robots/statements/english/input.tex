The first set of lines describes the first maze and its occupants. Subsequently, the second set of lines describes the second maze and its occupants.

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, $R_1$ and $C_1$, the number of rows and columns in maze 1.

\begin{itemize}
\item The next $R_1$ lines each contain $C_1$ characters specifying the maze layout. The robot's starting square is specified by an 'X'. A '.' represents an open space and '\#' represents a wall. Each maze will contain exactly one robot. 

\item Following the maze layout is a single line with a single integer $G_1$, the number of guards in the first maze ($0 \le G_1 \le 10$).

\item Each of the next $G_1$ lines describes a guard's patrol as three integers and a character, separated by single spaces. The first two integers specify the row and column of the starting square of the guard. The third integer specifies the number of squares ($2 \ldots 4$) in the guard's patrol path. The character specifies the initial direction the guard is facing: 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W' (north, south, east, and west, respectively).
\end{itemize}

The description of the second maze follows the description of the first, in the same format but with potentially different values.

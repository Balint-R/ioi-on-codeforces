The first line of the output should contain a single integer $K$ ($K \leq 10000$), the number of commands for both robots to exit the maze without being captured. If such a sequence of commands exists, the shortest sequence will have no more than 10000 commands. The next K lines are the sequence of commands, each containing a single character from the set {'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'}. If no such sequence exists, output a single line containing "-1". 

Both robots should exit their mazes by the end of the commands. The last command should cause at least one of the robots to exit its maze. If multiple sequences of
commands cause the robots to exit in the minimum time, any will be accepted.

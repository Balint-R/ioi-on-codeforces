The first line contains one integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 20000$): the number of trees in the forest. The second line contains one integer $T$ ($1 < T \le N$): the minimum number of trees to be cut. The following $N$ lines describe the positions of the N trees. Each of these lines contains two integers X and Y ($0 \le X,Y \le 64000$): the x-coordinate followed by the y-coordinate of a tree.

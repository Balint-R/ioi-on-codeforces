The first line of the output is to contain one integer $H$: the number of empodia in the input biosequence. The following $H$ lines describe all empodia of the input biosequence in the order of appearance of the starting point in the biosequence. Each of these lines is to contain two integers $A$ and $B$ (in that order) separated by a space, where the $A$-th element of the input biosequence is the first element of the empodio and the $B$-th element of the input biosequence is the last element of the empodio.

The first line contains first the integer $Q$: the number of cypress trees the son is to select; then the integer $M$, the number of fields; and then the integer $K$, the number of strips ($0 \le Q \le 150\,000$, $0 \le M \le 2000$, $0 \le K \le 2000$).
. The second line contains $M$ integers $N_1, N_2, \ldots N_M$ ($1 \le i \le M$, $3 \le N_i \le 150$): the numbers of cypress trees in fields. The third line contains $K$ integers $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_K$ ($1 \le i \le K$, $3 \le R_i \le 150$: the numbers of cypress trees in strips. Total number of trees on all fields and strips is at least $Q$.

The first line contains one integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 20000$): the number of messages to be sent. The following N lines contain the coordinates of the N street junctions where the messages are to be sent. These N lines are in the order in which the messages are to be sent. Each of these N lines contains two integers $X_i$, $Y_i$ ($-1000 \le X_i,Y_i \le 1000$): first the x-coordinate and then the y-coordinate of the street junction.

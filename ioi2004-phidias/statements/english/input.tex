The first line of input contains two integers: first $W$, the width of the original slab, and then $H$, the height of the original slab ($1 \le W, H \le 600$). The second line contains one integer $N$ ($0 < N \le 200$): the number of desired plate sizes. The following $N$ lines contain the desired plate sizes. Each of these lines contains two integers: first the width $W_i$ ( and then the height $H_i$) of that desired plate size ($1 \le i \le N$, $1 \le W_i \le W$, $1 \le H_i \le H$).

The output format is similar to the input format. The second line is to contain one integer $N_A$: the number of vertices in A ($2 \le N_A \le 4$). The following $N_A$ lines describe the vertices of A in the counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $I+2$ (for $I = 1, 2, \ldots, N_A)$ contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $I$-th vertex of the polygon $A$. 

Line $N_A+3$ should contain one integer $N_B$: the number of vertices in $B$, ($2 \le N_B$). The following $N_B$ lines describe the vertices of B in the counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $N_A$+J+3 (for $J = 1, 2, \ldots, N_B$) contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $J$-th vertex of the polygon $B$.

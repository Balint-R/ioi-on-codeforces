Consider a nondecreasing sequence of integers $s_1, \ldots, s_{n+1}$ ($s_i \le s_{i + 1}$ for $1 \le i \le n$). The sequence $m_1, \ldots, m_n$
defined by $m_i = \frac{s_i + s_{i + 1}}{2}$, for $1 \le i \le n$, is called the mean sequence of sequence $s_1, \ldots, s_{n + 1}$. For example,
the mean sequence of sequence \texttt{1, 2, 2, 4} is the sequence \texttt{1.5, 2, 3}. Note that elements of the mean sequence
can be fractions. However, this task deals with mean sequences whose elements are integers only.

Given a nondecreasing sequence of n integers $m_1, \ldots, m_n$, compute the number of nondecreasing sequences of $n + 1$ integers $s_1, \ldots, s_{n + 1}$ that have the given sequence $m_1, \ldots, m_n$ as mean sequence.

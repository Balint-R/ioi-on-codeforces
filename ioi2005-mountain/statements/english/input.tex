The first line of input contains one positive integer $n$~--- the number of rails, $1 \le n \le 1\,000\,000\,000$. The
following lines contain reconfigurations interleaved with rides, followed by an end marker. Each line contains
one of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reconfiguration~--- a single letter 'I', and integers $a$,$b$ and $D$, all separated by single spaces ($1 \le a \le b \le n, -1\,000\,000\,000 \le D \le 1\,000\,000\,000$).

\item Ride~--- a single letter 'Q', and an integer h ($0 \le h \le 1\,000\,000\,000$) separated by a single space;

\item A single letter 'E'~--- the end marker, indicating the end of the input data.
\end{itemize}

You may assume that at any moment the elevation of any point in the track is in the interval $0$ to $10^9$ centimetres. The input contains no more than $100\,000$ lines.

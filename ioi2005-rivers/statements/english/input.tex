The first line of input contains two integers: n~--- the number of villages other than Bytetown ($2 \le n \le 100$),
and k~--- the number of additional sawmills to be built ($1 \le k \le 50$ and $k \le n$). The villages are numbered
$1, 2, \ldots, n$, while Bytetown has number 0.

Each of the following $n$ lines contains three integers, separated by single spaces. Line $i + 1$ contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item $w_i$~--- the number of trees cut near village i per year ($0 \le w_i \le 10\,000$),
\item $v_i$~--- the first village (or Bytetown) downriver from village i ($0 \le v_i \le n$),
\item $d_i$~--- the distance (in kilometres) by river from village i to vi ($1 \le d_i le 10000$).
\end{itemize}

It is guaranteed that the total cost of floating all the trees to the sawmill in Bytetown in one year does not
exceed 2000000000 cents.

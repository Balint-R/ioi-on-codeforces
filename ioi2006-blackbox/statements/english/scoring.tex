If your submission has a `\t{.}'', ``\t{/}'' or ``\t{\textbackslash}'' character in an incorrect position, you'll get zero points for that box.

Let $n$ be the size of box, and let $B$ be the number of discovered positions in your submission, then percentage of your score for that test would be
$\frac{100 \cdot B}{n^2}$.

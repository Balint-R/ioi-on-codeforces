Tests for this problem are open.

First line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$ "--- number of vertices in graphs $H$ and $G$ ($1 \le N \le 4$, $1 \le M \le 1000$).

Next there is adjacency matrix of graph $H$: $N$ lines,
each consist of $N$ integers, $j$-th integer in $i$-th line is equal to $1$,
if vertices $i$ and $j$ and joined by an edge, and $0$ in opposite case.

Next there is adjacency matrix of graph $G$ in same format.

If it's possible to construct the commerce route, write $c$ lines, each
with an integer that represents the order in which the cities are visited
in the commerce route. If it's not possible to construct a commerce
route that meets all the requirements, output a single line containing
the number \texttt{-1}.

If there is more than one commerce route that meets the requirements, any of them you
output will be considered correct.

LINE 1: Contains the integer $g$ ($3 \le g \le 50\,000$)~--- number of green points.

NEXT $g$ LINES: Each line contains two space-separated integers that
represent the coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$ of each of the $g$ green
points, starting from $1$ to $g$.

LINE $g + 2$: Contains integer $r$ ($3 \le r \le 50\,000$)~--- number of red points.

NEXT $r$ LINES: Each line contains two space-separated integers that
represent the coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$ of each of the $r$ red points,
starting from $1$ to $r$.

Points are placed according to problem statement for some $s$ ($0 < s \le 200\,000\,000$).

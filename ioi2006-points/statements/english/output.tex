Your output file must contain $(g - 1) + (r - 1)$ lines, one for every line
segment drawn to join points.

Each line must contain three space-separated entities: two integers
and a character.The two integers represent the numbers of two
points joined by that line segment. The character must be a $g$ if the
points are green and an $r$ if the joined points are red.

The order in which you list the line segments does not matter; neither
does the order of the endpoints of each line segment.

LINE 1: Contains six space-separated integers, respectively: $m$ ($3 \le m \le 1000$), $n$ ($3 \le n \le 1000$), $a$ ($3 \le a \le m$),
$b$ ($3 \le b \le n$), $c$ ($1 \le c \le a - 2$), and $d$ ($1 \le d \le b-2$).

NEXT $n$ LINES: Each line contains $m$ space-separated integers that
represent the elevations of one row of the grid. The first of these
lines represents the top row (row 1) of the grid, and the last line
represents the bottom row (row $n$). The $m$ integers in each line
represent the elevations of squares of that row starting from
column 1. All elevations are integers in the range from 1 to 100.

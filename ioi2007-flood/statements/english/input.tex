The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 100\,000$), the number of points in the plane.

Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ (both between $0$ and $1\,000\,000$, inclusive), the coordinates of one point. The points are numbered $1$ to $N$ in the order in which they are given. No two points will be located at the same coordinates.

The following line contains an integer $W$ ($1 \le W \le 2 \cdot N$), the number of walls.

Each of the following $W$ lines contains two different integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \le A, B \le N$), meaning that, before the flood, there was a wall connecting points $A$ and $B$. The walls are numbered $1$ to $W$ in the order in which they are given.

The first line of input contains four integers in this order:

\begin{itemize}
\item The board type $B$ $(1 \le B \le 3)$;

\item The number of animals $N$ $(1 \le N \le 100\,000)$;

\item The largest distance $D$ at which two animals can hear each other $(1 \le D \le 100\,000\,000)$;

\item The size of the board $M$ (the largest coordinate allowed to appear in the input):

\begin{itemize}
\item When $B=1$, $M$ will be at most 75\,000\,000.

\item When $B=2$, $M$ will be at most 75\,000.

\item When $B=3$, $M$ will be at most 75.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each of the following $N$ lines contains $B$ integers separated by single spaces, the coordinates of one toy animal.

Each coordinate will be between $1$ and $M$ (inclusive).

More than one animal may occupy the same cell.

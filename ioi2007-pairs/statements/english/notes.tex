Use a 64-bit integer type to calculate and output the result (long long in C/C++).

Clarification for the leftmost example. Suppose the animals are numbered 1 through 6 in the order in which they are given. The four pairs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1-5 (distance 5)
\item 1-6 (distance 2)
\item 2-3 (distance 0)
\item 5-6 (distance 3)
\end{itemize}

Clarification for the middle example. The eight pairs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1-2 (distance 2)
\item 1-4 (distance 4)
\item 1-5 (distance 3)
\item 2-3 (distance 3)
\item 2-4 (distance 4)
\item 3-4 (distance 3)
\item 3-5 (distance 4)
\item 4-5 (distance 3)
\end{itemize}

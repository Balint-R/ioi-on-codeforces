The first line of input contains an integer $N$ $(2 \le N \le 100\,000)$, the number of masts on the ship.

Each of the following N lines contains two integers $H$ and $K$ ($1 \le H \le 100\,000, 1 \le K \le H$), the height and the number of sails on the corresponding mast. Masts are given in order from the front to the back of the ship.

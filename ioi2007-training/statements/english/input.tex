The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$ $(2 \le N \le 1\,000, N - 1 \le M \le 5\,000)$, the number of cities and the total number of roads.

Each of the following $M$ lines contains three integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ $(1 \le A, B \le N, 0 \le C \le 10\,000)$, describing one road. The numbers $A$ and $B$ are different and they represent the cities directly connected by the road. If $C = 0$, the road is paved; otherwise, the road is unpaved and $C$ represents the cost of blocking it.

Each city is an endpoint for at most $10$ roads. There will never be more than one road directly connecting a single pair of cities.

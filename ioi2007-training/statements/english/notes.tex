There are five possible routes for Mirko and Slavko. If the roads 1-3, 3-5 and 2-5 are blocked, then Mirko and Slavko cannot use any of the five routes. The cost of blocking these three roads is 5.

It is also possible to block just two roads, 2-4 and 2-5, but this would result in a higher cost of 6.

Your program must read from the standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1 contains the integer $F$ ($1 \le F \le 500,000$), the original number of fish in the lake.
\item Line 2 contains the integer $K$ ($1 \le K \le F$), the number of kinds of gemstones.
The kinds of gemstones are represented by integers 1 to $K$, inclusive.
\item Line 3 contains the integer $M$ ($2 \le M \le 30\,000$).
\item Each of the following F lines describes one fish using 2 integers separated by a single space: the length $L_x$ ($1 \le L_x \le 1\,000\,000\,000$) of the fish followed by the kind of gemstone originally swallowed by that fish.
\end{itemize}

For all test cases used for evaluation, it is guaranteed that there is at least one gemstone from each of the $K$ kinds.

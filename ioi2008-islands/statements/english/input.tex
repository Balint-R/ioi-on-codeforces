Your program must read from the standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1 contains the integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 1\,000\,000$), the number of islands in the park. Islands are numbered from 1 to $N$, inclusive.
\item Each of the next $N$ lines describes a bridge. The $i$-th of these lines describes the bridge constructed from island $i$ using two integers separated by a single space. The first integer represents the island at the other endpoint of the bridge, the second integer represents the length $L_i$ $(1 \le L_i \le 100\,000\,000)$ of the bridge. You may assume that for each bridge, its endpoints are always on two different islands.
\end{itemize}

Your program must read from the standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1 contains the integer $N$ $(1 \leqslant N \leqslant 25\,000)$, the number of words you need to print.
\item Each of the next $N$ lines contains a word. Each word consists of lower case letters (`a' -- `z') only and has length between $1$ and $20$, inclusive. All words will be distinct.
\end{itemize}

You need to print $N$ words on a movable type printer. Movable type printers are those old printers that require you to place small metal pieces (each containing a letter) in order to form words. A piece of paper is then pressed against them to print the word. The printer you have allows you to do any of the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a letter to the end of the word currently in the printer.
\item Remove the last letter from the end of the word currently in the printer. You are only allowed to do this if there is at least one letter currently in the printer.
\item Print the word currently in the printer.
\end{itemize}

Initially, the printer is empty; it contains no metal pieces with letters. At the end of printing, you are allowed to leave some letters in the printer. Also, you are allowed to print the words in any order you like.

As every operation requires time, you want to minimize the total number of operations.

You must write a program that, given the $N$ words you want to print, finds the minimum number of operations needed to print all the words in any order, and outputs one such sequence of operations.

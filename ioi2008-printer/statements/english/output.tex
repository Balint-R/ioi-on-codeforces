Your program must write to the standard output the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1 must contain an integer $M$ that represents the minimum number of operations required to print the $N$ words.
\item  Each of the next $M$ lines must contain one character each. These characters describe the sequence of operations done. Each operation must be described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding a letter is represented by the letter itself in lowercase
\item Removing the last letter is represented by the character ``\t{-}'' (minus, ASCII code $45$)
\item Printing the current word is represented by the character ``\t{P}'' (uppercase letter P)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

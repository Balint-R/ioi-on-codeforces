Your program must read from the standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1 contains two integers separated by a single space that represent $M$ and $N$ respectively $(1 \le M, N \le 1\,000\,000)$.
\item Line 2 contains the integer $B$ $(0 \le B \le 2\,000\,000\,000)$, the maximum cost you can afford (i.e., your budget).
\item Line 3 contains the integer $P$ $(1 \le P \le 400\,000)$, the number of obstacles found in the survey.
\item Each of the next $P$ lines describes an obstacle. The $i$-th of these lines describes the $i$-th obstacle. Eachline consists of $5$ integers: $X_{i1}$, $Y_{i1}$, $X_{i2}$, $Y_{i2}$ $(1 \le X_{i1} \le X_{i2} \le M; 1 \le Y_{i1} \le Y_{i2} \le N)$ and $C_i$ $(1 \le C_i \le 7\,000)$ separated by single spaces. They represent
respectively the coordinates of the bottommost leftmost cell of the obstacle, the coordinates of the topmost rightmost cell of the obstacle, and the cost of removing the obstacle. The bottommost leftmost cell on the grid has coordinates (1, 1) and the topmost rightmost cell has coordinates $(M, N)$.

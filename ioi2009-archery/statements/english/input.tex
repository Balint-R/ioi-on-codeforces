Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ ($1 \le N \le 200\,000$) and $R$ ($2 \cdot N \le R \le 1\,000\,000\,000$), separated by a space.
\item The next $2 \cdot N$ lines list the ranks of the archers. The first of these lines contains your rank. The rest of these lines contain the ranks of the other archers, one archer per line, in the order in which they have arranged themselves (from left to right). Each of these $2 \cdot N$ lines contains a single integer between $1$ and $2 \cdot N$ inclusive. A rank of $1$ is the best and a rank of $2 \cdot N$ is the worst. No two archers have the same rank.
\end{itemize}

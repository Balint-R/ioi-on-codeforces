In the first example, you are the second worst archer. If you start on target $1$, you will then go to target $4$ and stay there until the end. If you start on target $2$ or $4$, you will just stay there for the whole tournament. If you start on target $3$, you will beat the worst archer and then move to target $2$ and stay there. 

In the second example, you are the second best archer. The best one is already on target $1$ and will stay there for the whole duration of the tournament. Thus, no matter where you start, you will always move from your target, going through all targets from $4$ to $1$ over and over again. In order for you to end on target $1$ after $9$ transitions, you have to start on target $2$.

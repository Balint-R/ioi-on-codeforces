Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$, separated by a space.
\item The next $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100$)lines describe the rates of the parking spaces. The $s$-th of these lines contains a single integer $R_s$ ($1 \le Rs \le 100$), the rate of parking space number $s$ in dollars per kilogram.
\item The next $M$ ($1 \le M \le 2\,000$)lines describe the weights of the cars. The cars are numbered from $1$ to $M$ inclusive in no particular order. The $k$-th of these $M$ ( lines contains a single integer $W_k$ ($1 \le W_k \le 10\,000$), the weight of car $k$ in kilograms.
\item The next $2\cdot M$ lines describe the arrivals and departures of all cars in chronological order. A positive integer $i$ indicates that car number $i$ arrives at the garage. A negative integer $-i$ indicates that car number $i$ departs from the garage. No car will depart from the garage before it has arrived, and all cars from $1$ to $M$ inclusive will appear exactly twice in this sequence, once arriving and once departing. Moreover, no car will depart from the garage before it has parked (i.e., no car will leave while waiting on the queue).

In the first example:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Car number $3$ goes to space number $1$ and pays $300 \cdot 2 = 600$ dollars.
\item Car number $2$ goes to space number $2$ and pays $100 \cdot 3 = 300$ dollars.
\item Car number $1$ goes to space number $1$ (which was released by car number 3) and pays $200 \cdot 2 = 400$ dollars.
\item Car number $4$ goes to space number $3$ (the last remaining) and pays $800 \cdot 5 = 4\,000$ dollars. 
\end{enumerate}

In the second example:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Car number $3$ goes to space number $1$ and pays $1\,000 \cdot 5 = 5\,000$ dollars.
\item Car number $1$ goes to space number $2$ and pays $100 \cdot 2 = 200$ dollars.
\item Car number $2$ arrives and has to wait at the entrance.
\item Car number $4$ arrives and has to wait at the entrance behind car number $2$. When car number $1$ releases its parking space, car number $2$ parks there and pays $500 \cdot 2 = 1\,000$ dollars.
\item 
When car number $3$ releases its parking space, car number $4$ parks there and pays $2\,000 \cdot 5 = 10\,000$ dollars. 
\end{enumerate}

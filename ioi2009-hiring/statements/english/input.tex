Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ ($1 \le N \le 500\,000$) and $W$ ($1 \le W \le 10\,000\,000\,000$), separated by a space.
\item The next $N$ lines describe the candidates, one candidate per line. The $k$-th of these lines describes candidate number $k$ and it contains the integers $S_k$ ($1 \le S_k \le 20\,000$) and $Q_k$ ($1 \le Q_k \le 20\,000$), separated by a space.
\end{itemize}

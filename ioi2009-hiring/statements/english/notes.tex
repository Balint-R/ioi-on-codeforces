In the first example, the only combination for which you can afford to hire two workers and still meet all the constraints is if you select workers $2$ and $3$. You can pay them $80$ and $8$ dollars respectively and thus fit in your budget of $100$.

In the second example, you can afford to hire all three workers. You pay $1$ dollar to worker $1$ and $1.50$ dollars each to workers $2$ and $3$, and you manage to hire everyone with the $4$ dollars that you have.

In the third example, you cannot afford to hire all three workers, as it would cost you $60$ dollars, but you can afford to hire any two of them. You choose to hire workers $2$ and $3$ because they would cost you the smallest sum of money, compared to the other two-worker combinations. You can pay $10$ dollars to worker $2$ and $15$ dollars to worker $3$ for a total of $25$ dollars. If you were to hire workers $1$ and $2$ you would have to pay them at least $10$ and $20$ dollars respectively. If you were to hire $1$ and $3$, then you would have to pay them at least $10$ and $30$ dollars respectively.

Your program must write to standard output the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line must contain a single integer $H$, the number of workers that you hire.
\item The next $H$ lines must list the identifying numbers of the candidates you choose to hire (each of them a different number between $1$ and $N$), one per line, in any order.
\end{itemize}

For any given test case, you will receive full points if your choice of candidates enables you to achieve all of your goals, while satisfying all constraints. If you produce an output file with a correct first line (i.e., a correct value of $H$), but which does not meet the above description, you will receive $50\%$ of the points for that test case. 

For a number of tests, worth a total of $50$ points, $N$ will not exceed $5\,000$.

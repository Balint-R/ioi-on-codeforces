Your program must write to standard output a single line containing a single integer: the maximum possible number of minutes that Mecho can continue eating honey at his initial location, while still being able to get home safely.

If Mecho cannot possibly reach his home before the bees catch him, the number your program writes to standard output must be $-1$ instead.

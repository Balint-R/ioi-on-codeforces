Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ ($1 \le N \le 2\,000$), $T$ ($1 \le T \le 2\,000$) and $P$ ($1 \le P \le N$), separated by individual spaces.
\item The next $N$ lines describe which tasks were solved by which contestant. The $k$-th of these lines describes which tasks were solved by the contestant with ID $k$. Each such line contains $T$ integers, separated by spaces. The first of these numbers denotes whether or not contestant $k$ solved the first task. The second number denotes the same for the second task and so on. These $T$ numbers are all either $0$ or $1$, where $1$ means that contestant $k$ solved the corresponding task, and $0$ means that he or she did not solve it. 
\end{itemize}

The first problem was unsolved by only one contestant, so it is worth $1$ point. The second problem was unsolved by two contestants, so it is worth $2$ points. The third problem was unsolved by four contestants, so it is worth $4$ points. Thus the first contestant has a score of $4$; the second contestant (Philip), the fourth and the fifth contestants all have a score of $3$; and the third contestant has a score of $1$. Contestants $2$, $4$ and $5$ are all tied according to the first tiebreak rule (number of problems solved), and according to the second tie-break rule (smaller ID) Philip ranks before the others. Thus Philip's rank in the final standings is 2. He is only behind the
contestant with ID $1$.

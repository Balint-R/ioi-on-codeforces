Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N, M \le 50$), separated by a single space.

\item The next $N$ lines describe how many raisins there are on each piece of the chocolate. The $k$-th of these $N$ lines describes the $k$-th row of the chocolate. Each such line contains $M$ integers $R_{k,p}$ ($1 \le R_{k,p} \le 1000$) separated by single spaces. The integers describe the pieces on the corresponding row in order from left to right. The $p$-th integer on the $k$-th line (among these $N$ lines) tells you how many raisins are on the piece in the $k$-th row and the $p$-th column.
\end{itemize}

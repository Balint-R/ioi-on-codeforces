Your program must read from standard input the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line contains the integers $N$ ($1 \le N \le 500\,000$), $U$, $D$ ($1 \le D \le U \le 10$) and $S$ ($1 \le S \le 500\,001$), in this order, separated by single spaces.
\item The next $N$ lines describe the $N$ fairs in no particular order. The $k$-th of these $N$ lines describes the $k$-th fair and contains three integers separated by single spaces: the day of the fair $T_k$ ($1 \le T_k \le 500\,000$), its location $L_k$ ($1 \le L_k \le 500\,001$), and its profitability for the salesman $M_k$ ($1 \le M_k \le 4\,000$).
\end{itemize}

All locations given in the input will be different. That is to say, no two fairs will happen at the same location and no fair will happen at the salesman's home.

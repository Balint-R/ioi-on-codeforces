An optimal schedule would visit fairs 1 and 3 (the ones at locations 80 and 75). The sequence of events and their associated profits and costs would be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The salesman travels 20 meters upstream at a cost of 100 dollars. Profit so far: -100
\item He attends fair number 1 and earns 100. Profit so far: 0
\item He travels 5 meters upstream at a cost of 25. Profit so far: -25
\item He attends fair number 3 where he earns 150. Profit so far: 125
\item He travels 25 meters downstream to return home at a cost of 75. Profit at the end: 50 
\end{itemize}

{\bf Subtask 1 [25 points]}

\t{HC(N)} must call \t{Guess(G)} at most $500$ times. There will be at most $125\,250$ calls to \t{HC(N)}, with N between $1$ and $500$.

{\bf Subtask 2 [25 points]}

\t{HC(N)} must call \t{Guess(G)} at most $18$ times. There will be at most $125\,250$ calls to \t{HC(N)}, with N between $1$ and $500$.

{\bf Subtask 3 [25 points]}

HC(N) must call \t{Guess(G)} at most $16$ times. There will be at most $125\,250$ calls to \t{HC(N)}, with N between $1$ and $500$.

{\bf Subtask 4 [up to 25 points]}

Let $W$ be the largest integer, such that $2^W \le 3 N$. For this subtask your solution will score:
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ points, if \t{HC(N)} calls \t{Guess(G)} $2W$ times or more
\item $25\alpha$ points, where $\alpha$ is the largest real number, such that $0 < \alpha < 1$
and \t{HC(N)} calls \t{Guess(G)} at most $2W-\alpha W$ times,
\item 25 points, if \t{HC(N)} calls \t{Guess(G)} at most $W$ times.
\end{itemize}

There will be at most $1\,000\,000$ calls to \t{HC(N)} with $N$ between $1$ and $500\,000\,000$.

Be sure to initialize any variables used by \t{HC} every time it is called.

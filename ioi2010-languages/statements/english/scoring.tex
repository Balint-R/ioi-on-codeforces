{\bf Subtask 1 [30 points]}
Your submission must achieve accuracy of $0.3$ or better on the grading server.

{\bf Subtask 2 [up to 80 points]}
Your score will be $114\cdot (\alpha - 0.3)$, rounded to the nearest integer, where $\alpha$ is the accuracy of your submission.

You would be tested on both example and secret test. You can receive at most $110$ points on secret test. Because of technical reasons, we can't set $0$ points for public test. So, you can receive $0.01$ points for public test. Don't be surprised much by this.

Grader reads input in following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line $1$: $N$, $M$, and $K$.
\item Lines $2$ to $M+1$: For $0 \le i < M$, line $i+2$ contains $R[i][0]$, $R[i][1]$, and $L[i]$, separated by a space.
\item Line $M+2$: a list of $K$ integers $P[0], P[1],\ldots, P[K-1]$, separated by a space.
\item Line $M+3$: the expected solution. 
\end{itemize}

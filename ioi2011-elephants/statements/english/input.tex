The sample grader reads the input in the following format:

\begin{itemize}
\item Line $1$: $N$, $L$, and $M$, where $M$ is the number of acts in the show.
\item Lines $2$ to $N+1$: the initial positions; i.e., line $k+2$ contains $X[k]$ for $0 \le k < N$.
\item Lines $N+2$ to $N+M+1$: information on $M$ acts; i.e. line $N+1+j$ contains $i[j]$, $y[j]$, and $s[j]$, separated by a space, denoting that in the $j$ act elephant $i[j]$ moves to position $y[j]$, and after that act, $s[j]$ is the mininal number of cameras needed, for $1 \le j \le M$. 
\end{itemize}

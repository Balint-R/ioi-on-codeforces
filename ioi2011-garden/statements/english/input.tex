Grader reads input in following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line $1$: $N$, $M$, and $P$.
\item Lines $2$ to $M+1$: description of the trails; i.e., line $i+2$ contains $R[i][0]$ and $R[i][1]$, separated by a space, for $0 \le i < M$.
\item Line M+2: $Q$.
\item Line M+3: array $G$ as a sequence of space-separated integers.
\end{itemize}

The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line $1$: $N$ and $K$.
\item Lines $2$ to $N$: information on the highways; i.e., line $i+2$ contains $H[i][0]$, $H[i][1]$, and $L[i]$, separated by a space, for $0 \le i < N-1$.
\item Line $N+1$: the expected solution. 
\end{itemize}

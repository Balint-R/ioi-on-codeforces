For this case, there are multiple optimal locations for the hub: you can place it anywhere between locations $10$ and $14$, inclusive. The figure above shows one of these optimal locations. You will then be able to transport rice from fields at coordinates $10$, $12$, and $14$. For any optimal hub location, the total cost of this transportation will be at most $6$ Baht. Clearly, no hub location will allow us to gather rice from more than three fields, hence this solution is optimal and \t{besthub} should return $3$.

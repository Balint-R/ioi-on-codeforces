The constraints are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $100 \leq H \leq 500$
\item $100 \leq W \leq 500$
\end{itemize}
There are no subtasks. Instead, your score for this task will be based on how many images your program correctly classifies.

Suppose you correctly classify P percent of the images (so $0 \leq P \leq 100$):
\begin{itemize}
\item If $P < 25$ then you will score $0$ points.
\item If $25 \leq P < 50$ then you will score between $0$ and $10$ points, on a linear scale. Specifically, your score will be $10 \cdot \frac{P -­ 25}{25}$, rounded down to the nearest integer.
\item If $50 \leq P < 90$ then you will score between $10$ and $100$ points, on a linear scale. Specifically, your score will be $10 + \left(90 \cdot \frac{P -­ 50}{40}\right)$, rounded down to the nearest integer.
\item If $90 \leq P$ then you will score $100$ points.
\end{itemize}

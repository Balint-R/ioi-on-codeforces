The sample grader reads input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$: $N$
\item line $2$: $S[0]\ S[1]\dots S[N­ - 1]$
\item line $3$: $D[0]\ D[1]\dots D[N­ - 1]$
\end{itemize}


Here $N$ is the number of doors and switches, $S[i]$ is the correct position for switch $i$, nd $D[i]$ is the door that switch $i$ is connected to.

Consider the first example.
The shortest time to put all the toys away is three minutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c| }
\hline
 & Weak robot 0 & Weak robot 1 & Weak robot 2 & Small robot 0 & Small robot 1\\
\hline
First minute & Toy 0 & Toy 4 & Toy 1 & Toy 6 & Toy 2\\
\hline
Second minute & Toy 5 & & Toy 3 & & Toy 8\\
\hline
Third minute & & & Toy 7 & & Toy 9\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In the second example no robot can pick up the toy of weight $5$ and size $3$, and so it is impossible for the robots to put all of the toys away.

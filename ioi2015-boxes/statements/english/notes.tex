In the example we have $N = 3$ teams, Aman's carrying capacity is $K = 2$, and the number of sections is $L = 8$. The teams are located in sections $1$, $2$, and $5$.

One of the optimal solutions is shown in the picture above. In his first trip Aman takes two souvenirs, delivers one to the team in section $2$, then the other to the team in section $5$, and finally he returns to section $0$. This trip takes $8$ seconds. In his second trip Aman brings the remaining souvenir to the team in section $1$ and then returns to section $0$. He needs another $2$ seconds to do this. Thus, the total time is $10$ seconds.

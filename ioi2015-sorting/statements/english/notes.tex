\textbf{Example 1}

Suppose that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The initial sequence is $S=4,3,2,1,0$.
\item Ermek is willing to make $M=6$ swaps.
\item The sequences $X$ and $Y$ that describe the indices Ermek is going to choose are $X=0,1,2,3,0,1$ and $Y=1,2,3,4,1,2$. In other words, the pairs of indices that Ermek plans to choose are (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (0, 1), and (1, 2).
\end{itemize}

In this setting Aizhan can sort the sequence $S$ into the order $0,1,2,3,4$ in three rounds. She can do so by choosing the indices (0, 4), (1, 3), and then (3, 4).

The following table shows how Ermek and Aizhan modify the sequence.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Round & Player & Pair of swapped indices & Sequence\\
\hline
beginning & & & 4,3,2,1,0\\
\hline
0 & Ermek & (0,1) & 3,4,2,1,0\\ 
\hline
0 & Aizhan & (0,4) & 0,4,2,1,3\\
\hline
1 & Ermek & (1,2) & 0,2,4,1,3\\
\hline
1 & Aizhan & (1,3) & 0,1,4,2,3\\
\hline
2 & Ermek & (2,3) & 0,1,2,4,3\\
\hline
2 & Aizhan & (3,4) & 0,1,2,3,4\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Example 2}

Suppose that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The initial sequence is $S=3,0,4,2,1$.
\item Ermek is willing to make $M=5$ swaps.
\item The pairs of indices that Ermek plans to choose are (1, 1), (4, 0), (2, 3), (1, 4), and (0, 4).
\end{itemize}

In this setting Aizhan can sort the sequence $S$ in three rounds, for example by choosing the pairs of indices (1, 4), (4, 2), and then (2, 2). The following table shows how Ermek and Aizhan modify the sequence.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Round & Player & Pair of swapped indices &  Sequence\\
\hline
beginning & & & 3,0,4,2,1 \\
\hline
0 & Ermek & (1,1) & 3,0,4,2,1 \\
\hline
0 & Aizhan & (1,4) & 3,1,4,2,0 \\
\hline
1 & Ermek & (4,0) & 0,1,4,2,3 \\
\hline
1 & Aizhan & (4,2) & 0,1,3,2,4 \\
\hline
2 & Ermek & (2,3) & 0,1,2,3,4 \\
\hline
2 & Aizhan & (2,2) & 0,1,2,3,4\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

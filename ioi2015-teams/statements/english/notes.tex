Consider the first example.

The students' constraints on team sizes are given in the table below:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Student & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
$A$ & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline
$B$ & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4\\\hline
\end{tabular}
There are $Q = 2$ days.

On the first day there are $M = 2$ projects. The required team sizes are $K[0] = 1$ and $K[1] = 3$. These two teams can be formed by assigning student $0$ to a team of size $1$ and the remaining three students to a team of size $3$.

On the second day there are $M = 2$ projects again, but this time the required team sizes are $K[0] = 1$ and $K[1] = 1$. In this case it is not possible to form the teams, as there is only one student
who can be in a team of size $1$.

The sample grader reads the input in the following format:

\begin{itemize}
\item line 1: Subtask number and the number of test cases.
\item line 2: $N_1$, the number of small towns in the first test case.
\item following $N_1$ lines: The $j$-th number $(1\le j \le N_1)$ in the $i$-th of these lines $(1 \le i \le N_1)$ is the distance between small towns $i - 1$ and $j - 1$.
\item The next test cases follow. They are given in the same format as the first test case.
\end{itemize}

Each input file describes one grid representing a garden and gives the number of kids $k$ invited by grandpa. The format is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item line 1: $m$, $n$, $k$ ($1 \leq m, n \leq 1024$)
\item line $1 + i$ (for $1 \le i \le m$): row $i$ of the grid, which is a string of length $n$, consisting of the following characters (without any whitespace):
\begin{itemize}
\item `.': a free cell,
\item `\#': a rock.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

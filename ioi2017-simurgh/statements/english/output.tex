The sample grader outputs `YES', if \texttt{find\_roads} calls \texttt{count\_common\_roads} at most $30\,000$ times, and returns the correct set of royal roads. Otherwise, it outputs `NO'.

Beware that the procedure \texttt{count\_common\_roads} in the sample grader does not check whether $r$ has all properties of a golden set. Instead, it counts and returns the number of labels of royal roads in the array $r$. However, if the program you submit calls \texttt{count\_common\_roads} with a set of labels that does not describe a golden set, the grading verdict  will be `Wrong Answer'.

Maryam is an electrical engineer. She is designing wiring on a communication tower. On the tower there are some connection points, placed at distinct heights. A wire can be used to connect any two connection points. Each connection point can be connected to an arbitrary number of wires. There are two types of connection points: red and blue.

For the purpose of this problem the tower should be viewed as a line and the connection points as blue and red points that are at non-negative integer coordinates on this line. The length of a wire is the distance between the two connection points it connects.

Your goal is to help Maryam find a wiring scheme such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each connection point has at least one wire to a connection point of a different color.
\item The total length of the wires is minimized.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation details}

You should implement the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{int64 min\_total\_length(int[] r, int[] b)}
\begin{itemize}
\item $r$: array of length $n$ containing the positions of the red connection points in increasing order.
\item $b$: array of length $m$ containing the positions of the blue connection points in increasing order.
\item This procedure should return the minimum total length of wires, among all valid wiring schemes.
\item Note that the return type of this procedure is `int64'.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bf{Subtasks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points) N = 3

\item (95 points) No additional constraints. For this subtask, your score for each test case is calculated as follows. Let $q$ be the number of calls to press.

\begin{itemize}
\item If $q \le N+2$, your score is $95$.
\item If $N+2 < q \le N+10$, your score is $95 - 3 \cdot (q - N-2)$.
\item If $N+10 < q \le 2* N+1$, your score is $25$.
\item If $max\{N+10, 2N+1\} < q \le 4N$, your score is $5$.
\item Otherwise, your score is $0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Note that your score for each subtask is the minimum of the scores for the test cases in the subtask.

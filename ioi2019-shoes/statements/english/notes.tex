\textbf{Example 1}

Consider the following call:

\texttt{count\_swaps([2, 1, -1, -2])}

Adnan can obtain a valid arrangement in $4$ swaps.

For instance, he can first swap shoes $1$ and $-1$, then $1$ and $-2$, then $-1$ and $-2$, and finally $2$ and $-2$.
He would then obtain the following valid arrangement: $[-2, 2, -1, 1]$.
It is not possible to obtain any valid arrangement with less than $4$ swaps.
Therefore, the procedure should return $4$.

\textbf{Example 2}

In the following example, all the shoes have the same size:


\texttt{count\_swaps([-2, 2, 2, -2, -2, 2])}


Adnan can swap the shoes at positions $2$ and $3$ to obtain the valid arrangement $[-2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2]$, so the procedure should return $1$.

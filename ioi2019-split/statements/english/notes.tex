\textbf{Example 1}

Consider the following call:

\begin{verbatim}
find_split(9, 4, 2, 3, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5],
                       [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 7, 7, 5, 6])
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{1.png}

A possible correct solution is $[1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3]$.
This solution describes the following partition: $A=\{0, 1, 3, 7\}$, $B=\{4, 5\}$, and $C=\{2, 6, 8\}$.
The sets $A$ and $B$ are connected.

\textbf{Example 2}

Consider the following call:

\texttt{find\_split(6, 2, 2, 2, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}

\includegraphics{2.png}

No valid partition exists. Therefore, the only correct answer is $[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.

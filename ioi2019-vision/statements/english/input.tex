The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line 1: $H$ $W$ $K$ ($1 \leq H, W \leq 200$, $2 \leq H \cdot W$, $1 \leq K \leq H+W-2$)
\item line $2+i$ $(i \geq 0)$: $r_1[i]$ $c_1[i]$ $r_2[i]$ $c_2[i]$
\item last line: $-1$
\end{itemize}

Each line excepting the first and the last line represents an image with two black pixels.
We denote the image described in line $2+i$ by image $i$.
One black pixel is in row $r_1[i]$ and column $c_1[i]$ and the other one in row $r_2[i]$ and column $c_2[i]$.

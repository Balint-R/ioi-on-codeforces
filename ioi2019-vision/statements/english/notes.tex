Assume $H=2$, $W=3$, $K=3$. There are only two possible images where the distance between the black pixels is $3$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: black pixels are $0$ and $5$
\item Case 2: black pixels are $2$ and $3$
\end{itemize}

A possible solution is to build a robot's program by making the following calls:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{add\_and([0, 5])}, which adds an instruction that outputs $1$ if and only if the first case holds. The output is stored in cell $6$.
\item \texttt{add\_and([2, 3])}, which adds an instruction that outputs $1$ if and only if the second case holds. The output is stored in cell $7$.
\item \texttt{add\_or([6, 7])}, which adds an instruction that outputs $1$ if and only if one of the cases above holds.
\end{enumerate}

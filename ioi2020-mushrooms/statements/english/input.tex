The sample grader reads an array $s$ of integers giving the mushroom species. For all $0 \leq i \leq n-1$, $s[i] = 0$ means the species of mushroom $i$ is A, whereas $s[i] = 1$ means the species of mushroom $i$ is B. The sample grader reads input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$: $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 20\,000$)
\item line $2$: $s[0]\ s[1] \ldots s[n-1]$
\end{itemize}

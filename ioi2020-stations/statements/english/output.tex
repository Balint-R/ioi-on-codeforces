The sample grader prints the result in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$: $m$
\end{itemize}

$r$ blocks corresponding to the consecutive scenarios in the input follow. The format of each block is
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item line $1 + j$ ($0 \leq j \leq q - 1$): \t{index} of the station, whose \t{label} was returned by the $j$-th call to \t{find\_next\_station} in this scenario.
\end{itemize}

Note that each run of the sample grader calls both \t{label} and \t{find\_next\_station}.

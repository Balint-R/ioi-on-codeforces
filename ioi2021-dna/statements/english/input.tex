The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$: $n\ q$ ($1 \leq n, q \leq 100\,000$)
\item line $2$: $a$
\item line $3$: $b$
\item line $4 + i$ ($0 \leq i \leq q - 1$): $x\ y$ ($0 \leq x \leq y \leq n-1$) for the $i$-th call to \texttt{get\_distance}. 
\end{itemize}

Each character of $a$ and $b$ is one of ``A'', ``T'', and ``C''.

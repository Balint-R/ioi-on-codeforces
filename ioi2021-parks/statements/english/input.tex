The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$ : $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$)
\item line $2+i$ ($0 \leq i \leq n - 1$): $x[i]\ y[i]$ ($2 \leq x[i], y[i] \leq 200\,000$, $x[i]$ and $y[i]$~--- are even integers)
\end{itemize}

No two fountains have the same location.

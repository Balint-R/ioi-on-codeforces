The output of the sample grader is in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$: the return value of  \texttt{construct\_roads}
\end{itemize}

If the return value of \texttt{construct\_roads} is $1$ and \texttt{build(u, v, a, b)} is called, the grader then
additionally prints:

\begin{itemize}
\item line $2$: $m$
\item line $3+j$ ($0 \leq i \leq m - 1$): $u[j]\ v[j]\ a[j]\ b[j]$
\end{itemize}

The sample grader reads the input in the following format
\begin{itemize}
\item line $1$ : $s\ n\ k\ q$ ($0 \leq s \leq 1$, $2 \leq n \leq 100$, $1 \leq k \leq 10$, $q \leq 4000$)
\end{itemize}

This is followed by some number of lines, each describing a single test case. Each test case is
provided in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a[0]\ a[1]\ldots \ a[n - 1]$ ($0 \leq a[i] \leq 2^k-1$)
\end{itemize}

and describes a test case whose input consists of $n$ integers $a[0], a[1],\ldots, a[n-1]$.
The
description of all test cases is followed by a single line containing solely $-1$.
